make_training_data.py

Executing functions for creating npz files containing the training data
Functions will create training data for either
	- Patchwise sampling
	- Fully convolutional training of single image conv-nets
	- Fully convolutional training of movie conv-nets

Files should be plased in training directories with each separate
dataset getting its own folder
