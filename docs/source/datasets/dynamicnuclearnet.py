DynamicNuclearNet is a training dataset for nuclear segmentation and tracking published in
Schwartz et al. 2023. The dataset is made up of two subsets, one for tracking and one for
segmentation.

This dataset is licensed under a `modified Apache license <http://www.github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-tf/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ for non-commercial academic use only

The dataset can be accessed using `deepcell.datasets` with a DeepCell API key.

TODO add api key info

Tracking
^^^^^^^^

Each batch of the dataset contains three components

* X: raw fluorescent nuclear data
* y: nuclear segmentation masks
* lineages: lineage records including the cell id, frames present and division links from parent to daughter cells
