    'Cell culture':
        'For our cytoplasmic data, NIH3t3 and Raw263.7 cell lines were '
        'cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1x '
        'penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic. Cells were incubated at 37C in a '
        'humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. When 70-80% confluent, cells were '
        'passaged and seeded onto fibronectin coated glass bottom 96-well '
        'plates at 10,000-20,000 cells/well. The seeded cells were then '
        'incubated for 1-2 hours to allow for cell adhesion to the bottom of '
        'the well plate before imaging.',
    'Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fluorescent Labeling':
        'To stain cell cytoplasm, each well was triturated 5-10 times and '
        'then washed with serum free DMEM to remove dead or nonadherent cells. '
        '100uL of Cell Tracker CMFDA diluted to 2uM with serum free DMEM was '
        'added to each well and then incubated for 15 minutes at 37C. '
        'Cell Tracker was the aspirated and cells were then resuspended in '
        '100uL of Hoescht 33342 diluted to 20uM using phenol-free DMEM '
        'supplemented with 10% FBS and 1x penicillin-streptomycin. The cells '
        'were then incubated at 37C for 5 minutes. The cells were then washed '
        '2 times with phenol-free complete media and then resuspended in '
        '200uL of phenol-free complete media.',
    'Imaging':
        'Cells were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-2 fluorescence microscope at '
        '20x and 40x for NIH3t3 and Raw293.6 cells respectively. The well '
        'plate was placed in a Nikon incubated stage with an Oko labs '
        'environment controller set to 37C and 5% CO2. '
        'Cytoplasm labeled with Cell Tracker CMFDA was visualized using the '
        'Nikon Sola LED light source and a Semrock GFP-4050B filter cube. '
        'Nuclei labeled with Hoescht 33342 were visualized with the same light '
        'source and a Semrock DAPI-3060 filter cube. Each data set was '
        'generated using the Nikon jobs function to image all fluorophores '
        'and phase as well as a z-stack of phase images.'
