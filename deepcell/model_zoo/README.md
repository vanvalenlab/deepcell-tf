# deepcell.model_zoo

`deepcell-tf` features a wide array of model architectures, including best-in-class detection/segmentation models like [MaskRCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) as well as deepcell's own featurenets, which use dilated max-pooling and a configurable `receptive_field` parameter for semantic segmentation.

These models are all `keras.models` and can easily fit into any `keras` deep learning workflow.
