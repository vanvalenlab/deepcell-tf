# deepcell.model_zoo

`deepcell-tf` features several model architectures for cell segmentation. All of the models in this library are `keras.models` and can easily fit into any `keras` deep learning workflow. These include:

* [FeatureNets](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005177) - This architecture was introduced in the first DeepCell paper and is quite effective for analyzing images with a single relevant length scale. This architecture is governed by a single control parameter, the receptive field, which controls the size of the spatial region around each pixel used to make predictions for that pixel. These models can perform instance segmentation by predicting a transform of the instance masks - e.g. whether pixels are edge/interior/background or a distance transform that can be used with watershed. While these are no longer the state-of-the-art, they're easy to train and are still effective - particularly for bacterial images.

* PanopticNets - These architectures use [feature pyramid networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144) for segmentation tasks. They consist of a backbone (e.g. resnet50), a feature pyramid, and one (or more) semantic head(s). We have found these to be very effective for cell segmentation. Our current approach to segmentation with this architecture borrows from the [DeepDistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11211) method as well as [location-aware](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05300-5) deep learning models. By including a location layer and predicting the inner distance (the distance of every pixel in a cell to the cell's center of mass) and outer distance (distance of every pixel in a cell to the background) transforms, these models can perform instance segmentation in a manner that is as accurate as bounding box based approaches, but is easier to deploy on large images.

* [Siamese Model](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/803205v2) This architecture, contained within featurenet.py, is used for cell tracking. It was inspired by [previous](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Sadeghian_Tracking_the_Untrackable_ICCV_2017_paper.html) object tracking models, and uses multiple features (cell appearance, neighborhood appearance, centroid motion, and morphological information) to link cells together over time.
